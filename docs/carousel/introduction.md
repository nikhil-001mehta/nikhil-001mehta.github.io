import { SubHeader } from "./subheader";

<SubHeader/>

#### This is a  tiny(1.2Kb), framework agnostic, light weight, zero dependancy, touch friendly carousel component

## Why should I use it while there is slick-carousel and others out there

Most of the carousel components out there depends on jquery and other third party libraries that is no longer useful in latest browsers. additionally they do not leverage latest css and javascript features like css scroll snap, flex order, webcomponents/custom elements etc.  Using these latest  features makes carousel much more eligent, reliable, light weight and framework agnostic
